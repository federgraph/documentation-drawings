# documentation-drawings

I will do the wiki first and then add code.

The code will be a Delphi FMX project called **RG79**.


RG79 will compact the library code into one unit.
We will end up with:

- A main form which is a generic UI for all drawings.
- A library unit with drawing elements and more.
- A bunch of example drawings.

The wiki will explain the example drawings in some detail.
You should find it easy to create new documentation drawings for your project.
See repository RiggVar-RG38, it already contains the code for the documentation drawings, in expanded form.
